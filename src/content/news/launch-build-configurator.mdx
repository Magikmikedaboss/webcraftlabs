Today we're launching **WebCraft's Online Build Estimator** — a transparent, step‑by‑step configurator that gives you instant pricing for a custom marketing website.

## Why we built it

For years, clients asked: "How much will my site cost?" The answer was always "It depends." Now it doesn't.

The estimator walks you through the same questions we'd ask in a discovery call:

- What type of site do you need? (marketing, e‑commerce, lead generation)
- How many pages?
- What features matter most? (contact forms, booking, integrations)
- Do you need copywriting, SEO, or ongoing maintenance?

Based on your answers, you get a **detailed, line‑item estimate** you can download, share, or use as a starting point for a formal proposal.

## What you can do with it

1. **Get instant pricing** – No more back‑and‑forth emails. See real numbers as you adjust features.
2. **Compare packages** – Toggle between "Essential," "Growth," and "Complete" tiers to see what fits your budget.
3. **Understand the process** – Each selection explains *why* it matters and how it impacts your site's performance.
4. **Save & share** – Download a PDF summary or generate a shareable link for your team.

## How it works

The estimator uses the same pricing engine we use for client proposals. It's not a generic calculator — it's built on **real project data** from 150+ websites we've delivered.
